      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Gently rinse and dry the mushrooms. Cut off the caps and cut them into
          strips. Dice the stems. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the butter and olive
          oil. When the fat is hot, add the garlic and cook for 1 minute,
          stirring constantly. Add the mushrooms and cook for 2-3 minutes until
          the mushrooms release their liquid, it cooks off, and they begin to
          brown. Add the rice and cook for 3 minutes, stirring regularly. Stir
          in salt and onion powder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gradually and gently stir in 3 1/2 cups wate. Set heat to medium-high
          and bring to a boil. Return heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer for
          15 minutes or until water is absorbed and rice is cooked through.
          While you wait, coarsely grate the Swiss cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          When rice is cooked through, remove from heat and stir in the cheese
          until melted. If desired, top with chopped fresh parsley.

          Serve to an Izutsumi . . . and try not to be offended when she says
          she doesn’t like mushrooms!
