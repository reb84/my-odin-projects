      "First, you chop the mandrakes up, then stir-fry them for a bit. Crack an
      egg. Whip it. Once it gets all fluffy in the pan, itâ€™s ready!"
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large parsnip</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 lb bacon</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt, divided</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/8 tsp pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Peel and dice the parsnip. Set aside. Crack the eggs into a measuring
        cup along with 1 tablespoon of water and whisk thoroughly. Whisk in 1/4
        teaspoon salt and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut bacon into bits and add to a large saute pan over medium heat. Cook
        to desired doneness, stirring regularly. Remove bacon to a paper
        towel-lined plate to drain, draining all but 2 tablespoons of bacon fat
        from the pan (reserve the unused bacon fat). Add the parsnip, 1/4 tsp
        salt, garlic powder, and pepper to the pan. Cook for 5 minutes or until
        fork tender, stirring regularly. Remove parsnip to the plate with the
        bacon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 tablespoon reserved bacon fat to a medium saute pan over
        medium-low heat. Whisk the remaining 1/4 tsp salt into the egg mix. When
        pan is hot, pour in the egg mix. Wait for the edges to set (less than a
        minute), then gently stir the mix with a fork or ball whisk. You want to
        break up the layer of egg on the bottom so the uncooked egg can run
        underneath, which helps the omelet become fluffy and evenly cooked.
        After a minute, the bottom will thicken, at which point you can stop
        stirring.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pile the parsnip mix on one side of the egg (you might not need all the
        parsnip mix). When egg is just about cooked through, flip the empty half
        over the top of the parsnip mix and cook for 1-2 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve to Laos and friends after they successfully harvest their first
        mandrake!
      </li>
    </ol>
